# Wine Fair Comparisons
The [Relative Scores](/Documentation/relative-score) of a wine is - as the name implies - a score *relative* to something, i.e. to other wines in a set or category. These categories are built so that a **fair comparison** can be drawn between wines. 

What does constitute a fair comparison among wines would probably be a matter of debate, but as a noncontroversial common ground it should be fair to assume that a comparison between wines in the same [appellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation) is fair. The aggregation of wines in the same appellation, we may say, is a *natural* form of categorization. In *AGReATWine* there are three types of categories for wines comparison:

- first level comparison: appellation;
- second level comparison: wine composition;
- third level comparison: region.
