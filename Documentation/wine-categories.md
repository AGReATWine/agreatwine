# Fair Comparison
The [Relative Scores](/Documentation/relative-score) of a wine is - as the name implies - a score *relative* to something, i.e. to other wines in a set or category. These categories are built so that a **fair comparison** can be drawn between wines. 

What does constitute a fair comparison among wines would probably be a matter of debate, but as a noncontroversial common ground it should be fair to assume that a comparison between wines in the same [appellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation) is fair. The aggregation of wines in the same appellation, we may say, is a *natural* form of categorization. In *AGReATWine* there are three types of categories for wines comparison:

- first level comparison: appellation;
- second level comparison: wine composition;
- third level comparison: region.

## Appellation

As already stated, comparison of wines in the same appellation is not really a controversial topic as appellations exist for the purpose of aggregating similar wines which are fair to compare. There is, however, a residual issue with appellation comparison since some appellations include completely different types of wines or wines with completely different compositions and type. Let's break this issue down into smaller parts:

1. some appellations include different types of wine;
2. some appellations include wines with different composition and type.

As an example of the first issue, consider the [DOCG Romagna Albana](http://catalogoviti.politicheagricole.it/scheda_denom.php?t=dsc&q=1058) (Romagna - Italy) which includes five different types of wine (dry, semi-sweet, sweet, sweet passito and sparkling) made with the same grape. In cases such as this the type takes precedence over the appellation, so the comparison is limited to same-type wine, as can be seen in the [Romagna Albana](/Appellations/Italy/Romagna/DOCG-Romagna-Albana). 

The second issue arises in the so-called "mixed appellations", which include wines with both different type and different composition. An example of a mixed appellation is the [DOC Alto Adige](http://catalogoviti.politicheagricole.it/scheda_denom.php?t=dsc&q=2010) appellation, which allows the production of more than 50 different permutations of wine type/wine composition. In cases such as this, the appellation is split between multiple sub-appellation which include same-composition wines and where only same-type wines are compared. So, we don't have a DOC Alto Adige comparison but a [DOC Alto Adige Chardonnay](/Appellations/Italy/Alto-Adige/DOC-Alto-Adige-Chardonnay), [DOC Alto Adige Sauvignon](/Appellations/Italy/Alto-Adige/DOC-Alto-Adige-Sauvignon), etc.

Exceptions to the above rules are discussed where they happen.
