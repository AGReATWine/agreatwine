# Fair Comparison
The [Relative Scores](/Documentation/relative-score) of a wine is - as the name implies - a score *relative* to something, i.e. to other wines in a set or category. These categories are built so that a **fair comparison** can be drawn between wines. 

What does constitute a fair comparison among wines would probably be a matter of debate, but as a noncontroversial common ground it should be fair to assume that a comparison between wines in the same [appellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation) is fair. The aggregation of wines in the same appellation, we may say, is a *natural* form of categorization. In *AGReATWine* there are three types of categories for wines comparison:

- first level comparison: appellation;
- second level comparison: wine composition;
- third level comparison: region.

## Appellation

As already stated, comparison of wines in the same appellation is not really a controversial topic as appellations exist for the purpose of aggregating similar wines which are fair to compare. There is, however, a residual issue with appellation comparison since some appellations include completely different types of wines or wines with completely different compositions and type. Let's break this issue down into smaller parts:

1. some appellations include different types of wine;
2. some appellations include wines with different composition and type.

As an example of the first issue, consider the [DOCG Romagna Albana](http://catalogoviti.politicheagricole.it/scheda_denom.php?t=dsc&q=1058) (Romagna - Italy) which includes five different types of wine (dry, semi-sweet, sweet, sweet passito and sparkling) made with the same grape. In cases such as this the type takes precedence over the appellation, so the comparison is limited to same-type wine, as can be seen in the [Romagna Albana](/Appellations/Italy/Romagna/DOCG-Romagna-Albana). 

The second issue arises in the so-called "mixed appellations", which include wines with both different type and different composition. An example of a mixed appellation is the [DOC Alto Adige](http://catalogoviti.politicheagricole.it/scheda_denom.php?t=dsc&q=2010) appellation, which allows the production of more than 50 different permutations of wine type/wine composition. In cases such as this, the appellation is split between multiple sub-appellation which include same-composition wines and where only same-type wines are compared. So, we don't have a DOC Alto Adige comparison but a [DOC Alto Adige Chardonnay](/Appellations/Italy/Alto-Adige/DOC-Alto-Adige-Chardonnay), [DOC Alto Adige Sauvignon](/Appellations/Italy/Alto-Adige/DOC-Alto-Adige-Sauvignon), etc.

Exceptions to the above rules are discussed where they happen.

## Wine Composition
Building from the idea that it is fair to compare wines included in the same appellation, we may be tempted to ask ourselves if comparing wines with the same composition, from two different but geographically overlapping or close by appellations could *also* be fair. In the world of wine appellations there many such cases: Chardonnay based, adjacent appellations in Bourgogne; Sangiovese based overlapping/adjacent appellations in Toscana, etc. If we conceded that comparisons *within* the same appellation are fair, we may also concede that comparisons between same-composition wines, from different but overlapping appellations could also be fair.   

Without engaging is too much academy, *AGReATWine* provides partially controversial, second level comparisons of wines which meet all the following criteria:
- same region
- same composition (grape or grapes)
- different appellations

The available second level comparisons can be found in the [second level comparison](/second-level-comparisons) index page.

## Region
At the top of the speculative mountain, *AGReATWine* also provide ~~not-so-fair~~ regional comparisons, whose only significance could be to discover which wine has the best track record of evaluations within a region, whatever that may mean.

The available second level comparisons can be found in the [third level comparison](/third-level-comparisons) index page.
