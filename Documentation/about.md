As the acronym implies *AGReATWine* provides a **tool** for **aggregating** **wine** scores in a database. The sources of the aggregated scores are expert wine publications - the so called wine guides - scraped so that the relevant information can be stored in a machine readable format and then ranked, compared, etc. Since there is a delay from the time when a new vintage enters the market and the time when wine guides where it is reviewed are issued, the database is (almost) always one year behind the market, in a **retrospective** fashion. The database is built around a **relative** score, which tries to render the concept of *fair comparison*. All of this is showcased in the text-heavy, no-fancy, **geeky** website you are looking at.

In the current version, only (a subset of) Italian wines are aggregated. The progress status is available in the [status](/Documentation/status.html) page. If you want to contribute please contact mail at agreatwine dot net or use [GitHub](https://github.com/dev-crumbs/agreatwine).

To read more about the aggregation/ranking/comparison process, take a look at the [extendend about page](/Documentation/why-this-website.md). Some technicalities about this website and the database can be found in the [technical stuff](/Documentation/technical-stuff.md) page.
